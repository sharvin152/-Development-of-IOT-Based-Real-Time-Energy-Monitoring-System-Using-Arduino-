# -Development-of-IOT-Based-Real-Time-Energy-Monitoring-System-Using-Arduino-

This project was to develop an IoT system which connect sensors that its main function is to monitor energy consumption and other parameters that can be measured to identify anomalies and prevent untimely breakdowns. The energy utilization metrics aid homeowners in determining the total consumption of a facility and approaches to enhance the overall efficiency for greater cost savings.
